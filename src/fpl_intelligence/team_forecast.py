"""Point-in-time team and fixture forecasts for M10.

This module deliberately uses only completed match outcomes supplied by the
caller.  It is an intentionally small, deterministic Poisson-style baseline:
team attack and defence rates are shrunk towards league priors, then converted
to fixture goal, result, and clean-sheet probabilities.  It is an opt-in M10
candidate and does not replace the accepted benchmark projection.
